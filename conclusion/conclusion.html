results above show that the coverage of the Indego bikeshare system was limited
to the business clusters surrounding the city centre, and the bikeshare network
has not achieved its claim and ambition to specifically cater to disadvantaged
people.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>It is suggested that the bikeshare system should be promoted for use in
areas with a low proportion of white people, rather than merely being planned
based on income levels (Caspi, 2023).&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Residents in low-income neighbourhoods
may have insufficient awareness of the bikeshare system, partly because there
is less coverage of stations in these areas. Therefore, increasing relevant
publicity, education and community promotion activities is also a recommended
strategy to enhance the usage rate (Caspi &amp; Noland, 2019).&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Indego has
implemented measures such as cash payment options and discounted pricing for
food stamp holders, which should be continued. Also, more bikeshare stations could be built in north Philadelphia.
